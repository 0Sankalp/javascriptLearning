let name = 'Dwarika'
console.log(name.length)
// by this process you can print the lenght of the string

let friend ="Ganesh"
console.log (friend)
// as you can see that you can us both single and double quotation for using the string but if you are using ("") this so you have to complete the string from this("") otherwise it will not work if you use this ('')instead of this("")
